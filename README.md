You cloned the repo! The timer has now started.

If you were a real candidate and this were a real challenge, this repo could contain:

* Detailed instructions
* Boilerplate code
* Partial test suites
* Sample data

Or all of the above! Takehome has lots of sample challenges for all kinds of languages and stacks.

Better yet, it's easy to create your own challenges that fit the roles you're hiring for.

For now, just make a little change to this file, `git commit` and `git push`!
